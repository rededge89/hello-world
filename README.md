# hello-world

Hello and welcome to my GitHub!

I am a culinarian who has a passion for programming.  I have dabbled here and there and finally began dove head first into some C# coding over the last few months.  I opened a GitHub so I had a place to share projects.  I hope you enjoy some of the simplistic programs as as well as the other programs available.
